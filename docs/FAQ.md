# Frequently asked questions

## Any recommendations about the "Nodes should have a Public IP" requirement?
Yup, check out [this](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/AksNodePublicIPController) project, it will probably help

## Inspiration about this project?
Check out a [project](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/AzureContainerInstancesManagement) I worked on some time ago. This uses Azure Container Instances to scale dediated game servers on the Azure Cloud. Making a similar mechanism work with Kubernetes was the next logical step.
